\beginverse
\[Em]Give us our bread and \[G]bury our dead                           
and \[E9]kneel to the cross on the wall                            
Whether \[Em]burnt at the stake or \[G]drunk at the wake                             
Just \[E9]kneel to the cross on the wall                         
We've o\[Em]riginal sin, but we \[G]might just get in                            
If we \[E9]beg to the cross on the wall                         
It's \[Em]rattle your saber and \[G]love your neighbors                             
But \[E9]kneel to that cross on the wall.

\beginchorus       
\[Esus4]See the r\[Cmaj7]oof fall, \[Esus4]hear the \[Em]bells crash              
\[Esus4]As flesh \[Cmaj7]and bone \[Esus4]turns to \[Em]ash                    
\[Esus4]Tried to \[Cmaj7]conquer the sun \[Esus4]with a \[Em]Christian frost
\[Esus4]The corpses' stench\[Cmaj7 Esus4]  
be\[Em]neath the cross

\beginverse \chordsoff
And give them gold and they'll \[G]save your soul                           
And \[E9]kneel to the cross on the wall                          
And \[Em]hail to the boss of the \[G]great unwashed                           
And \[E9]kneel to the cross on the wall                      
They \[Em]wail and weep, the \[G]march of the sheep                             
As they \[E9]go to the cross on the wall                       
And it's \[Em]ever so wrong to \[G]dare to be strong                          
So \[E9]kneel to the cross on the wall

And it's \[Em]ever so \[G]wrong to \[E9]dare, to be strong
And it's \[Em]ever so \[G]wrong to \[E9]dare, to be strong                            
But \[Em]summer is a-\[G]coming and \[E9]arise! Arise!
But \[Em]summer is a-\[G]coming and \[E9]arise! Arise!
A\[Em]rise!
